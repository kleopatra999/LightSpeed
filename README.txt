Lightspeed is a visually stunning animation of a spaceship traveling through 
space I built using a little HTML5, clever JavaScript, and some CSS. 
I got the idea after implementing a Fireworks JavaScript animation as a birthday
present for a close friend who I accidently forgot to buy a present for. When I 
was starting to build it, I wanted to learn a Javascript animation framework, 
such as Processing.js or $fx. After looking at some example JavaScript 
animations, I discovered it was easiest to leverage the raw power of 
JavaScript + HTML5 on its own, without the use of a framework.

It features the controls:
Mouse Movement - changes the direction the ship is moving
Mouse Wheel - changes the speed at which the ship is moving
Mouse Click or ENTER or RETURN - makes the ship travel at lightspeed
P - pauses the animation
SPACE - the ship stops moving forward (stars don't move towards you anymore)
